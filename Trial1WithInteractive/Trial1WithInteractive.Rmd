## Introduction


This year there was no world-famous New York City marathon [1]. Normally, runners all from around the world come to run across all five boroughs during the first week of November [2]. A highly anticipated event, it usually brings together runners and New Yorkers alike. It was another disappointing - though necessary - cancellation in 2020. 

We thought that since we all missed the race in 2020, that we could do something fun:  look back to past NYC marathons. The marathon began in 1970, starting much smaller than today. It had a budget of only $1000, a $1 entry fee, and 55 finishers (out of 127 registered)[3]! To put that in perspective, in 2017 the entry fee was $255 and there were around 51,000 finishers[4]. 

In our blast from the past we found 29 years of data from the New York Road Runners club (organizers of the race since its start) that recorded the times of the marathon winners, both male and female, from 1970 to 1999.  We were curious to see how these times evolved over the years. 


## Data Graphic

```{r plotting, message=FALSE}
marplot<-ggplot(data = marathon, aes(x = year, y = time, color= time))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line()+
   geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~gender)+
  labs(title="NY City Marathon Times from 1970 to 1999",
       subtitle="Sourced from New York Road Runners Club",
       x= "Race Year",
       y ="First Place Run Time (Hours) ")+
  scale_color_continuous(breaks = c(2.134,2.391,3.1447),
                         labels = c(2.134, 2.391, 3.145),
                         low = "red", high = "blue")

```{r, fig.cap = "alt text"}

" First place run time for NY Marathon from 1970 - 2000. Empty data point for females in 1970 as there was only 1 female entree who did not complete the race [2]. From 1971-1975, females run time was above 2.7 hours. This drastically dropped in 1975. Following 1979, females had a more level run time, resting between 2.4 and 2.5 hours. Males were also slower in the 1970-1975 time frame, resting between 2.25 and 2.5 hours. After 1976, their run time leveled out as well, between 2.1 and 2.25 hours. There is a line of best fit for both graphs, with both lines showing a downward slope reflecting a decrease in winner's completion time, and females having a steeper downward slope, reflecting a greater degree of change."
```

As we can see - the times have gotten faster over the years.This does not come as much of a surprise as the race has become one of the most popular for runners in the world, increasing the chances for more people to cross the finish line [1]. The race also became more serious and respected, which encourages the participation of more serious runners and more serious training for the marathon [1]. While there is an overall increase in speed since the start of the race there is some fluctuation in time between the years. Sometimes, the trends in the men and womenâ€™s time match up (for example from 1971-1977) while during other periods there is a mismatch.


According to organizers the 2021 NYC Marathon is still set to go ahead, though the specifics including who the race will be open to are not yet released [5]. The pandemic has made going for a run easier for some, but harder for others. Go ahead and estimate your NYC Marathon readiness against the past race winners using the provided graph!

## Standards

In this assignment, we attempted the following [standards](https://beanumber.github.io/sds192/standards.html):

- `r standard_button("markdown")`: We mastered the markdown standard because we excluded all messages of unnecessary formatting of our data and package messages as well as including a plot, then went above and beyond and included an image, links to our sources, a quiz, and many organized and easy-to-read code chunks. We also made our article accessible with alt text for our data graphic. 

- `r standard_button("aesthetics")`: We mastered the aesthetic standard because we faceted our plot by gender, we used geom_point and geom_line to make the data easy to understand, we included a trend line, and we used color to make the change in time more evident.
